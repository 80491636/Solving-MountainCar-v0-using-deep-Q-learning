# MountainCar-v0
As described in [OpenAI's Gym documentation](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/):

A car is on a one-dimensional track, positioned between two "mountains". The goal is to drive up the mountain on the right; however, the car's engine is not strong enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. Therefore, the only way to succeed is to drive back and forth to build up momentum.
